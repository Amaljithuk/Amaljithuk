👋 Hi, I’m @amaljithuk
👀 I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with a combination of creativity and technology. I have experience with React Native, and I’m diving deeper into NLP and machine learning to expand my problem-solving toolkit.
🌱 I’m currently pursuing my MCA at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), and I’m eager to explore how mobile development and AI can intersect to create powerful, user-focused applications.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of mobile app development using AI.
